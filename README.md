Build will work as before, which means, Angular build without PWA will be generated.

`npm run build:pwa` will generate an Angular + PWA build. 

`npm run start:pwa` will start an http server, pointing dist folder. (Can be used to test PWA from local) 

`npm run serve:pwa` will generate an Angular + PWA build and starts http server from dist.
